# Gex 3 Level Viewer v0.1

This is a simple javascript tool that lets you view level geometry from the N64 game "Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko".

## TODO List:

1. Make the camera controls better. The current system was fine for Supercross 2000, but it won't really work here due to how spread out the levels are.
2. Find and add a better exporter, since glTF seems to be limited.
3. Add level objects to the viewer.
4. Find a way to speed up loading and reduce RAM usage.
