# BIGF Extractor v1.0

A simple tool that will allow you to extract files from a `.big` archive. This tool was created for the Nintendo 64 game Supercross 2000, though it could work with other N64 games created by EA Games.

This program was written in python 3.7

## How to use

Run `main.py` and type in the path of the `.big` file, or if you have a ROM file you can simply type in a range of the BIGF archive like: `supercross2000.u.z64 0x55F70-0xEE5D10`
