## Mission:Impossible 64 Viewer

A python tool that allows you to view & export models from Mission: Impossible. Currently only static models & levels can be loaded at the moment.

The 5 sliders control the viewer itself. The first slider is to control the rotation along the Y-axis. The second slider controls zooming in and out of the model. The last 3 sliders move the model along the 3 axis's.

Allows exporting to extended .obj model format. It is recommended that you use MeshLab to view the model with vertex colors.

Requires python3, pyqt 4, pyopengl 3.1.3, and pypng 0.019.
